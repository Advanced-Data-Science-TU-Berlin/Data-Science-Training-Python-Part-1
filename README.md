# How to install what I need in this course

The easiest way to install pandas is to install it as part of the Anaconda distribution, a cross platform distribution for data analysis and scientific computing. This is the recommended installation method for most users.

Instructions for installing from source, PyPI, ActivePython, various Linux distributions, or a development version are also provided.

Python version support
Officially Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

Installing pandas
Installing with Anaconda

Installing pandas and the rest of the NumPy and SciPy stack can be a little difficult for inexperienced users.

The simplest way to install not only pandas, but Python and the most popular packages that make up the SciPy stack (IPython, NumPy, Matplotlib, …) is with Anaconda, a cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) Python distribution for data analytics and scientific computing.

After running the installer, the user will have access to pandas and the rest of the SciPy stack without needing to install anything else, and without needing to wait for any software to be compiled.

Installation instructions for Anaconda can be found here.

Another advantage to installing Anaconda is that you don’t need admin rights to install it. Anaconda can install in the user’s home directory, which makes it trivial to delete Anaconda if you decide (just delete that folder).
